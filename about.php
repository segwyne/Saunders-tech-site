<img src="theme/profile.jpg" alt="Photo of author"><p>Hi!  My name is Judy Saunders and I am a web developer and designer.</p>
<p>I was introduced to technology relatively early as a child in the late 80s and early 90s, when my father bought a TRS-80 so he could learn programming.  Back then he taught me BASIC and DOS, and I enjoyed writing programs that would sing songs.  In the late 90s, I got my hands on MS Access and embarked on a project to create a role-playing game, using the database to manage the players and characters.  I couldn't coordinate players to play the game, so the database ended up being nothing more than a theoretical exercise.  But oh, how I loved making it!</p>
<p>As the years went by, I got married, started a family, got divorced.  I withdrew from the world of technology management for many years until I met my husband.  His passion for technology rekindled my own and I began relearning things I had forgotten.  The intervening years, of course, brought many changes to the internet and the technology I was familiar with had become obsolete.</p>
<p>I decided to learn HTML so I could design websites and still be home with my family.  In the process, I learned CSS and gained familiarity with Javascript.  The game database from my younger days haunted me, so I decided to learn SQL and recreate it.  Even if the game never gets played, it will still be a fun and exciting challenge, pushing me to see what I can accomplish.</p>
<p>In my non-coding time, I enjoy listening to self-development podcasts, cooking delicious meals for my family, knitting lace, and historical interpretation at my local museum.</p>
