<h2 align="center">Coding is like Cooking</h2>
<p>You can pull out a freezer meal and just pop it in the microwave, you can open a box and mix in a few ingredients and heat it up on the stovetop, or you can pick out the highest-quality ingredients, chop the freshest vegetables, and savor the delight of your favorite meal cooked from scratch.</p>
<p>There are lots of freezer meal and box quality websites available, but to really savor the best web designs, you need a hand-made site, coded with care and love.<p>
